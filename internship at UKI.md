# Having the opportunity to join a big Social Media company in China



### Million Dollar Business

While I'm still studying online from my Country. I have the opportunities to get an online internship at [**UKI**](https://uki.neoclub.cn), a new social media company based in _Shanghai, China_.

First of all, **I have no idea** what it feels like to work at a social media company. We all know that these days our world is full with all kinds of social media platforms, from the big boys like **Facebook**, **Twitter**, and so on. Besides, supported by the facts and the data, all of these founders are SUPER RICH! They are some of the richest people in the world!

#### The Successor of Sillicon Valley

After gather some data and brainstorm, I just realized that after the _Microprocessor Era_ that started by **HP**, **Apple**, **Microsoft**, and others Computer and Software companies. These Social Media companies are next! In other words, they are the successor of _Tech BOOM!_ and keep _Silicon Valley_ in the top place, as the hottest spot of innovation on the planet.

> I believe if these social media companies didn't exist, _Tech Industry_ will not be the same as what we've seen right now.



#### What are my expectations?

Basically I don't really use social media that much, even I don't have any social media apps in my phone (yeah I want to live without them for good). But after thinking for a while, I think taking this opportunities will give me a wider scope of learning. Knowing _what's in the kitchen_ and how they create an APP that able people to connect is pretty damn interesting.

Without much consideration, I directly hit the recruiter, add their WeChat and just telling them how interested I'm to take this opportuniy.



#### I feel gratitude of being an Indonesian

At first, my friend only told me:

>C: "Hey Kelvin, do you want to take an internship? There is a social media company named **UKI** is looking for Indonesia students to join."
>
>Me: "Of course... Wait what? Why they specifically search for Indonesia students?"
>
>Thousands of text continue...

I extremely curious why they are searching for Indonesia students? Without any hesitation, I ask the recruiter for the answer. It makes me surprise knowing that they want to expand to **South East Asia**, and **Indonesia** is being the first target. Honestly speaking, it totally makes sense. Because **Indonesia** is a very big market for a social media platform.

All kinds of social media apps are here and all of them earn a pretty good income and cash flow (the pond is very big and the fish is very hungry). With all of this data, I think it totally _worth the jump_ for **UKI** to expand to Indonesia.

> My country is being the hottest spot for social media companies!
